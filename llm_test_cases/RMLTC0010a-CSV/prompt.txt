I have this country_info.csv file:
Country Code,Name,ISO 3166
1,"Bolivia, Plurinational State of",BO
2,"Ireland",IE
3,"Saint Martin (French part)",MF

and want this rdf graph:
<http://example.com/1> <http://example.com/name> "Bolivia, Plurinational State of" .
<http://example.com/2> <http://example.com/name> "Ireland" .
<http://example.com/3> <http://example.com/name> "Saint Martin (French part)" .

can you generate the rml mapping for me?
