I have this country_info.csv file:
Country Code,Name,ISO 3166
1,"Bolivia, Plurinational State of",BO
2,Ireland,IE
3,"Saint Martin (French part)",MF

and want this rdf graph:
<http://example.com/1/Bolivia%2C%20Plurinational%20State%20of> <http://example.com/name> "Bolivia, Plurinational State of" .
<http://example.com/2/Ireland> <http://example.com/name> "Ireland" .
<http://example.com/3/Saint%20Martin%20%28French%20part%29> <http://example.com/name> "Saint Martin (French part)" .

can you generate the rml mapping for me?
