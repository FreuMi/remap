I have this persons.csv file:
fname,lname,amount
Bob,Smith,30
Sue,Jones,20
Bob,Smith,30

and want this rdf graph:
_:BobSmith30 <http://example.com/amount> "30" .
_:BobSmith30 <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Bob Smith" .
_:SueJones20 <http://example.com/amount> "20" .
_:SueJones20 <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Sue Jones" .

can you generate the rml mapping for me?
