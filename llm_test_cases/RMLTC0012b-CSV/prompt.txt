I have this lives.csv file:
fname,lname,city
Bob,Smith,London
Sue,Jones,Madrid
Bob,Smith,London

and this persons.csv file:
fname,lname,amount
Bob,Smith,30
Sue,Jones,20
Bob,Smith,30

and want this rdf graph:
_:BobSmith <http://example.com/city> "London" .
_:BobSmith <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Bob Smith" .
_:SueJones <http://example.com/city> "Madrid" .
_:SueJones <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Sue Jones" .

can you generate the rml mapping for me?
