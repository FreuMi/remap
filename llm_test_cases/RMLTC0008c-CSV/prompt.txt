I have this student.csv file:
ID,Name,Sport
10,Venus Williams,Tennis

and want this rdf graph:
<http://example.com/Student/10/Venus%20Williams> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name> "Venus Williams" .
<http://example.com/Student/10/Venus%20Williams> <http://example.com/name> "Venus Williams" .

can you generate the rml mapping for me?
